# Phase 3 Complete: Natural Language Query Interface

**Completion Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ✓ Complete and Tested

## Overview

Phase 3 implements a complete natural language query interface for the microfluidic device database, allowing users to interact with the system using plain English queries instead of predefined buttons or code.

## What Was Built

### 1. Query Processor (`src/query_processor.py`)
A pattern-based natural language processing system that:
- Detects query intent (compare, filter, analyze, track, plot, report, list, help)
- Extracts entities (device types, device IDs, flow parameters, metrics, fluids)
- Calculates confidence scores for intent detection
- Suggests clarifying questions when intent is ambiguous

**Key Features:**
- Pattern matching using regex for robustness
- Supports 8 different intent types
- Entity extraction for 8 different parameter types
- Confidence-based clarification system

### 2. CLI Interface (`query_cli.py`)
A standalone command-line tool for natural language queries:
- **Interactive mode**: Continuous query loop with colored output
- **One-shot mode**: Single query execution for scripting
- Rich formatting using `rich` library
- Automatic result formatting (DataFrames, plots, reports)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive mode
python query_cli.py

# One-shot mode
python query_cli.py "compare W13 and W14 devices"
python query_cli.py "help"
```

### 3. Analyst Integration (`src/analyst.py`)
Extended `DataAnalyst` class with natural language processing:
- Implemented `process_natural_language_query()` method
- Added 8 intent handlers:
  - `_handle_list_query()` - List available devices
  - `_handle_filter_query()` - Filter data by criteria
  - `_handle_compare_query()` - Compare devices/types
  - `_handle_analyze_query()` - Analyze parameter effects
  - `_handle_track_query()` - Track device performance over time
  - `_handle_plot_query()` - Generate visualizations
  - `_handle_report_query()` - Generate summary reports
  - Help handler for query syntax

**Query Processing Flow:**
```
User Query → Intent Detection → Entity Extraction →
Clarification (if needed) → Method Routing →
Result Generation → Formatted Output
```

### 4. Dashboard Integration (`dashboard.py`)
Enabled natural language queries in the GUI dashboard:
- Activated "Ask a Question" button (previously disabled)
- Added natural language query input dialog
- Integrated with `DataAnalyst.process_natural_language_query()`
- Displays results with plots and data previews

## Supported Query Types

### Comparisons
- "Compare W13 and W14 devices"
- "Compare devices at 5 ml/hr flowrate"
- "Show me the difference between W13 and W14"
- "Compare all devices at 500 mbar pressure"

### Filtering
- "Show me all W13 devices"
- "Filter by flowrate 5 ml/hr"
- "Find devices with NaCas fluid"
- "Show me devices at 5 ml/hr and 500 mbar"

### Analysis
- "Analyze flowrate effects for W13"
- "What's the effect of pressure on droplet size?"
- "Show correlation between flowrate and droplet size"
- "Analyze parameter effects for W14"

### Tracking
- "Track W13_S1_R1 over time"
- "Show device history for W13_S1_R2"
- "Monitor W14_S1_R1 performance"
- "How has W13_S1_R1 performed over time?"

### Plotting
- "Plot device type comparison"
- "Visualize flowrate effects"
- "Create a graph of W13 vs W14"
- "Plot DFU row performance"

### Reporting
- "Generate a summary report"
- "Create a report"
- "Summarize the data"

### Listing
- "List all devices"
- "What devices are available?"
- "Show me all device types"
- "Which devices have been tested?"

## Technical Implementation

### Intent Detection
Uses pattern matching with confidence scoring:
```python
intent_patterns = {
    'compare': [r'\b(compare|comparison)\b', r'\b(versus|vs\.?)\b', ...],
    'filter': [r'\b(filter|show me|give me|find)\b', ...],
    'analyze': [r'\b(analyze|analysis|effect|impact)\b', ...],
    # ... etc
}
```

### Entity Extraction
Supports extraction of:
- **Device types**: W13, W14
- **Device IDs**: W13_S1_R1, W14_S2_R3, etc.
- **Flowrates**: "5 ml/hr", "30 mlhr", "flowrate of 5"
- **Pressures**: "500 mbar", "pressure of 100"
- **Fluids**: NaCas, SDS, SO
- **Metrics**: droplet_size_mean, frequency_mean
- **DFU rows**: DFU1, DFU2, etc.
- **Dates**: DD/MM/YYYY, DDMMYYYY

### Clarification System
Automatically detects missing information:
```python
if 'device_type' not in intent.entities and intent.intent_type == 'analyze':
    return "Which device type would you like to analyze? (W13 or W14)"
```

## Output Capabilities

### Terminal Output
- Colored panels with status indicators
- Formatted DataFrames as tables
- File paths for generated plots
- Help text and error messages

### File Exports
- **Plots**: Saved to `outputs/analyst/plots/nl_query_*.png`
- **Reports**: Saved to `outputs/nl_query_report_*.txt`
- Timestamped filenames prevent overwrites

## Testing Results

### Test Queries Verified
✓ "help" - Displays comprehensive help text
✓ "list all devices" - Lists 5 devices with counts
✓ "compare W13 and W14 devices" - Generates comparison plot
✓ "show me W13 devices" - Filters and returns data
✓ "track W13_S1_R1" - Tracks device over time

### Performance
- Query processing: <1 second
- Plot generation: 2-3 seconds
- Database loading: ~1 second (612 records)

## Integration with Multi-LLM Architecture

The natural language interface supports the project's multi-LLM strategy:
- **Claude Code**: Primary interface (this implementation)
- **ChatGPT/Gemini**: Can use same query syntax via CLI
- **Team collaboration**: Different team members can use different LLMs
- **Cost optimization**: Distribute queries across LLM subscriptions

## Windows Compatibility

Fixed encoding issues for Windows:
- Removed Unicode bullets (• → -)
- Removed box drawing characters (━ → =)
- ASCII-only output for cp1252 encoding compatibility
- Tested on Windows 11 with Python 3.13

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced NLP**: Integrate spaCy or transformers for better intent detection
2. **Query history**: Save and recall previous queries
3. **Query suggestions**: Auto-complete based on past queries
4. **Voice input**: Speech-to-text for queries
5. **Batch queries**: Process multiple queries in sequence
6. **Query templates**: Saved query patterns for common analyses
7. **Natural language plot customization**: "Plot with log scale", "Use blue color"

### Known Limitations
- Pattern-based (not ML-based) intent detection
- Limited handling of complex multi-part queries
- No query chaining (e.g., "compare then plot")
- No conversational context retention
