## Why These Were Archived

These files were moved to archive during a repository cleanup (2025-11-12) to:
1. Keep the root directory clean and navigable
2. Focus on actively maintained code
3. Preserve development history for reference
4. Make the codebase more approachable for newcomers

## Active Development

For current documentation and tests, see:
- `/docs/` - Active documentation (guides and implementation notes)
- `/tests/` - Current test suite
- Root directory - Core application files

## Note

If you need to reference or resurrect any of these files, they remain in git history and can be restored if needed.
