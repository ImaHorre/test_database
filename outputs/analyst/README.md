### Plots Directory

The `plots/` subdirectory contains all visualization outputs:

- **Test Plots** - Generated during testing and method development
  - `test_device_comparison_*.png`
  - `test_flowrate_effect.png`
  - `test_pressure_effect.png`
  - `test_fluid_comparison.png`
  - `test_dfu_comparison.png`
  - `test_temporal_tracking.png`

- **Dashboard Plots** - Generated by interactive dashboard
  - `dashboard_device_comparison_*.png`
  - Named with timestamps for tracking

## Plot Naming Convention

Plots are named descriptively to indicate their content:
- `test_*` - Plots generated during testing/development
- `dashboard_*` - Plots generated by dashboard interface
- Timestamps are included when multiple versions exist

## Usage

These plots are:
- Generated automatically by analysis queries
- Saved for reference and sharing
- Not committed to git (typically in `.gitignore`)
- Recreated as needed from the database

## Related Components

- **Analyst Code:** `src/analyst.py`
- **Dashboard:** `dashboard.py`
- **Test Methods:** `tests/analyst/test_phase1_methods.py`

## Notes

- Plots are saved in PNG format for easy sharing
- High resolution for publication quality
- Can be regenerated from database at any time
- Consider periodically cleaning old test plots
